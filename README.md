# [AutoMind] - AI & Automation B2B Showcase Website

## Description

This repository contains the frontend code for the [AutoMind] website. The primary goal of this website is to serve as a global gateway, effectively showcasing a diverse and complex portfolio of AI and automation services to B2B clients, particularly in the European Union (EU) and Southeast Asian (SEA) markets.

The site aims to facilitate market entry, generate qualified leads, and establish credibility by clearly articulating the value proposition of our services, which include:

* n8n Expertise & Workflow Automation
* General AI Services (Machine Learning, NLP, Computer Vision)
* Retrieval Augmented Generation (GraphRAG) for enhanced AI accuracy with private data
* AI Agents for autonomous task execution
* Broader Automation & Robotics solutions

The website architecture follows a dual-pathway approach:
1.  **Services Section:** Details the technological toolkit ("ingredients").
2.  **Solutions Section:** Demonstrates applied value by industry and business challenge ("recipes").

## Setup & Usage

This project currently consists of static HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.

**To view the website locally:**

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/](https://github.com/)[YourUsername]/[YourRepositoryName].git
    cd [YourRepositoryName]
    ```
2.  **Open `index.html`:**
    You can often open the `index.html` file directly in your web browser.
3.  **(Recommended) Use a local web server:**
    For correct handling of relative paths and potential future features (like API calls), it's better to serve the files using a simple local server. If you have Python installed:
    ```bash
    # For Python 3
    python -m http.server
    ```
    Or using Node.js (requires `npm install -g http-server` first):
    ```bash
    http-server
    ```
    Then open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8000` (or the port specified by the server).
